Pythia mCP Simulation
=====================
This is a Pythia simulation of the hadronic contribution to mCP estimated by modifying the muon mass in Pythia to stand in for mCP and adjusting the hadron branching ratios to muons. The new branching ratio is estimated by fitting a quadratic to the branching ratios of e, mu, and a zero branching ratio when the mCP mass reaches half the decaying hadron mass.
